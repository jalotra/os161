# os161
Implementing this OS is the goal of Semester-8.

## Current Things to do : 
1. Install the Sys-161 and maybe Test-161(I am not sure about this).
2. Have to think about installing in Ubuntu-Bionic-Beaver since the official OPS-class PPA doesn't have a Release File for me.
3. Have to get started somehow, and think about a better IDE to choose.
4. I think I will prefer CLion but let's see.
