# os161
Implementing this OS is the goal of Semester-8.

## Current Things to do : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Done : 
1. Install the Sys-161 and maybe Test-161 -> I am not sure about this.
2. Have to think about installing in Ubuntu-Bionic-Beaver since the official OPS-class PPA doesn't have a Release File for me.
3. Have to get started somehow, and think about a better IDE to choose.
4. I think I will prefer CLion but let's see. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Have to read the ASST0 Full Webpage Throughly and read the official OS-161 Paper. 
2. Have to read the OS161 Source Code as much as I can this week.



## What I Have Accomplished : 
1. Got a way over and I am using Vagrant now.
2. I have compiled a vanilla Kernel using the DUMBVM Conf File.
